# RockPaperScissorGame
 In this small project, a small implementation of the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors" will be programmed using javascript. This project will simply be presentable on the console where a human will get to make a choice of rock, paper, or scissor, followed by the computer making a similar choice (the pick is based on probability). First day of the project (21/11/2023).

This project will be further expanded at a later time to create a web page with html and css, where the game can be played.

Update: date (16/01/2024)
After spending a lot of time learning about dom manipulation its finally time to complete the project. I have now created the UI for the game and now to fully complete the project I just need to change the code so the game is playable on the webpage.
