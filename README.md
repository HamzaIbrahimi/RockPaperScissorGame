# RockPaperScissorGame
First steps into creating a simple js program

In this small project, a small implementation of the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors" will be programmed using javascript. This project will simply be presentable on the console where a human will get to make a choice of rock, paper, or scissor, followed by the computer making a similar choice (the pick is based on probability). First day of the project (21/11/2023).

This project will be further expanded at a later time to create a web page with html and css, where the programmed game can be played.
